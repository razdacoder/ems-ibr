## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Installation Problems

**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fcntl'`
- **Cause**: Trying to use Gunicorn on Windows
- **Solution**: Use Django development server or Waitress instead
```bash
# Development
python manage.py runserver

# Production (Windows)
pip install waitress
waitress-serve --port=8000 core.wsgi:application
```

**Issue**: `ImproperlyConfigured: STATIC_ROOT setting must not be empty`
- **Cause**: Missing STATIC_ROOT configuration
- **Solution**: Ensure STATIC_ROOT is defined in settings.py

**Issue**: `DisallowedHost` error
- **Cause**: Domain not in ALLOWED_HOSTS
- **Solution**: Add your domain to ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py

#### 2. Data Import Issues

**Issue**: CSV upload fails
- **Check**: File encoding (must be UTF-8)
- **Check**: Column headers match expected format
- **Check**: No empty required fields
- **Check**: Date format is YYYY-MM-DD

**Issue**: Duplicate data errors
- **Cause**: Trying to import existing records
- **Solution**: Check for existing data before import
- **Solution**: Use unique identifiers (email, matric_no)

#### 3. Timetable Generation Issues

**Issue**: No timetable generated
- **Check**: Courses and classes are properly configured
- **Check**: Date range is valid (excludes Sundays)
- **Check**: Classes have associated courses

**Issue**: Scheduling conflicts
- **Check**: Class sizes vs. hall capacities
- **Check**: Course-class associations
- **Review**: Generated schedule for conflicts

#### 4. Distribution Problems

**Issue**: Classes not distributed to halls
