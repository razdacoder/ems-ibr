"""System-wide audit trail.

``AuditLogMiddleware`` records one ``AuditLog`` row for every authenticated,
state-changing API request (POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE under ``/api/``), every
authenticated file export (any GET that streams a download), plus a few
explicit auth events (login success/failure, logout). Plain read requests are
never logged. The row is written *after* the view runs so the captured status
code reflects the real outcome.

DRF's authentication runs inside the view and writes the resolved user back
onto the underlying Django request, so ``request.user`` is reliable here even
though token auth has no session middleware behind it.
