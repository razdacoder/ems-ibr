"""The per course seating rule, in one place (spec 0002).

Timetable, distribution, the allocator, reconcile and manual assignment all
read the limits and the neighbour sets from here, so the distribution model
and the seater cannot drift apart.

* ``strict``: no two students of a course touch in any of the 8 directions.
  One course is confined to one ``(r % 2, c % 2)`` quarter of a hall.
* ``relaxed``: only side, front and back neighbours are blocked. The course
  sits on the even parity seats (``r % 2 == c % 2``, quarters ``(0,0)`` and
  ``(1,1)``), which never share an edge. Used for a paper course too big for
  one period under the strict rule. At most one per period.

Everything here is pure: callers pass hall sizes as ``(rows, cols)`` pairs,
plus an optional seat ``mask`` for a hall that is not a full rectangle.

A mask is one string per row, ``X`` for a seat and ``.`` for no seat (short
row, aisle, pillar). Columns are physical positions, so a gap keeps the seats
either side of it from counting as neighbours. ``None`` means every cell of
the ``rows x cols`` grid is a seat. Seats are numbered 1..N over real seats
only, in the hall's seat order (:data:`SEAT_ORDERS`). The default, ``rows``,
numbers row by row from the left, so a full rectangle numbers exactly as
``r * cols + c + 1``. The allocator seats students in seat number order, so a
course's matric numbers follow whichever order the hall uses.
